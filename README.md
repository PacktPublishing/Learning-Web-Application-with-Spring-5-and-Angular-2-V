## About the Video Course
This course will teach you to use Angular 2 and Spring 5 to create a fully working login web application. The first of the three sections of this course is about front-end technologies, and in this part, you will learn the basic concepts of Angular 2 such as Services, Components, and how to use it to create a login component. 
Moving to the second section, we will focus on the backend, and bythe end of it, you will know what Spring 5 is and how to use it to develop a web reactive or web MVC application. 
In the last section, we will bring together the concepts of the previous two sections to create a login application. This course focuses on the practical aspects of these two frameworks, and you’ll get your hands dirty.
